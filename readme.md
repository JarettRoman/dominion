#Dominion Randomizer App
I like to play Dominion a lot, so this is a randomizer app that I plan on tailoring to my own preferences.  

#### TODO:
* ~~Grab 10 cards only~~
* ~~Images~~
* ~~Figure out rules for expansions like Prosperity, Dark Ages, and Adventures. Not all cards should be randomized.~~
* ~~Deal with cards with spaces and punctuation~~
* Isolate cards that involve playing with curses, ruins, add more actions, buys, cards, etc.
* ~~Fix crash bug where user clicks submit without selecting any set.~~
* ~~Make app single page only~~
* ~~Scaling images properly for different window widths~~
* ~~Improve request handling to get rid of annoying 'confirm form resubmission' alert~~
* ~~Implement a way to blacklist and whitelist cards.
* Put the Knights card in the randomizer.
* Blacklist works, but kind of buggy when there's a trailing comma. Working on more efficient way using more complex regexp
